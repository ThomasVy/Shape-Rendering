How to compile and run-
Cmake and Visual Studio 2019 compiler; I used the same tools as in the Windows 10 tutorial on D2L.


How to use -
Changing Scenes
Left Arrow Key - Go to the previous scene
Right Arrow Key - Go to the next scene
Or use scene buttons on GUI

Changing Iteration
Down Arrow Key - Go down an iteration
Up Arrow Key - Go up an iteration
Or use iteration slider GUI
